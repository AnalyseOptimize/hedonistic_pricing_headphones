# Hedonistic pricing using multilinear regression (LAD, FGLS, Quantile)

Hedonic Pricing is an economic model used to estimate the value of a good or service by breaking it down into its constituent characteristics or attributes. The core idea is that the price of a product is determined by the sum of the values of its individual features rather than the product as a whole.

We explore the market of headphones in Russia and particulary pricing in [DrHead](https://doctorhead.ru/?srsltid=AfmBOopl28H6e8TpSRQw0Lzxjcbgs_KbcvEXK7U9t45iYY8_P2YJQNLI) store, which has a special segment of professional headsets. 

Our project consists of:
- Deep data analysis using econometrics
- Evaluating models and it's robustness
- Interpretation via average marginal effects and quantile coefficients
- Developing our own model of gaussian mixture (without realisation)
